# MessyNapkin

Some notes about some stuff. The best thoughts are usually the ones in the interstitial points of time. Because this is a messy napkin, it is not where things should live as their end state. The ones that survive should be nicely formatted and published on a seperate website.

Each major folder in the root directory will have a single `Project.toml` Julia env in its top level. Even if there is nested dirs inside for mental decluttering, they depend on the top level project file.

## OpsResearch

Things vaguely operations research related. Obviously will include mostly optimization of mathematical models of processes. Purely statistical topics (estimation of parameters for inference only) will not be here.
