# Operations Research

To include: STNs have an AMPL example here <https://ampl.com/colab/notebooks/scheduling-multipurpose-batch-processes-using-state-task-networks-in-python.html> and can migrate my old work from <https://github.com/slwu89/Orcas.jl/blob/main/src/StateTaskNetwork.jl>

Need to migrate and finish my old stuff on PN reachability <https://github.com/slwu89/Orcas.jl/blob/main/src/PetriReachability.jl>

Drop some of the basic scheduling stuff <https://github.com/slwu89/Orcas.jl/blob/main/src/BasicSchedule.jl> into the scheduling dir.
